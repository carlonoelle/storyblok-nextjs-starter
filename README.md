# Storyblok Nextjs Starter with App Router

This is an opinionated starter including internationalised routing (i18n), full server component rendering (no live editing), Tailwind and full typesafety for your stories and bloks.

Also preinstalled is the nice [Storyblok Rich Text Renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storyblok-rich-text-react-renderer), which will surely come in handy, as well as next-sitemap.

I created this starter since i found myself constantly copying code when i started a new project. I am not partnered in any way with Storyblok, it's just my personal starter which i wanted to share because why not.

## Demo

[DEMO HERE](https://storyblok-nextjs-starter.vercel.app/)

You can see a deployed version of this repo here, using the Storyblok space as you can clone it yourself in the prequisites steps.

The demo has two languages: English and German
If you switch your browser language to english, you will see the homepage at `/`, if your browser is german, you will see `/de` in your path.

## Prequisites

- Clone the storyblok space by clicking this link: [https://app.storyblok.com/#/build/249345](https://app.storyblok.com/#/build/249345)
- remove the `.default` from the env files in root
- Add your preview token to the `.env.local` file
- You have to setup i18n options. Go to the file `/i18n-config.ts` and set it to your liking
  - You can have multiple domains, for different locales, or just use one domain for them all
  - Your default locale will be served from `/`, the other ones from subpaths, eg `/de`. This happens through rewrites in the middleware
- To enable autogeneration of TypeScript interfaces, you have to set your Storyblok space id in the `[SPACE_ID]` placeholders in `/package.json`
  - you also have to have the [Storyblok CLI](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/Guides/command-line-interface) globally installed and logged into your account
- If you want to configure your `sitemap` as well as `robots.txt`, do that in `/next-sitemap.config.ts`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To generate TS Interfaces:

```bash
npm generate-sb-types
# or
yarn generate-sb-types
# or
pnpm generate-sb-types
```
